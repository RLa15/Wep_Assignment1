          <p>Data Base Project</p>
          <p>Description:</p>
            <p>
            Since many mothers, whether teaching assistants or students, work on university campuses, 
            it can be difficult for them to balance work and childcare responsibilities.<br>
            These mothers may also feel neglected in their roles as mothers or at work.<br>
            Although the university has a nursery, some mothers may not be aware of it or know how to use it.<br>
            For this reason, me and my group decided to create a program that assists mothers in registering their children<br>
            so they can check on their kids while spending as little time as possible at work.

          <p>Description:</p>
          <p>
          Our professional lives depend heavily on transportation, which is why we occasionally run into issues with it.<br>
          Some of us struggle to get transportation as students, and these days the cost has increased, and it is not very safe.<br>
          Thus, me and my team focused on used a software we named "Esiway" to solve this issue.<br>
          The application allows the user to schedule a private or bus chauffeur,<br>
          if the arrangement is for travel from his house to the university or the opposite.<br>
          The application is accessible to all employees.or just attends university classes

            <p>IOT Project</p>
            <p>Description:</p>
            <p>
            Everybody has priceless items that need to be protected and preserved, such jewelry, homes, vehicles, and shops.<br>
            Hiring protection for these priceless possessions can be quite expensive, making it unfeasible for most people.<br>
            therefore (ir sensor) is the ideal solution.The best way to safeguard and preserve valuables while keeping costs down is to use sensors.<br>
            Motion detection sensors can be used to protect property by setting them up to detect any unusual behavior.<br>
            The sensor is intended to light an LED when motion is detected.
